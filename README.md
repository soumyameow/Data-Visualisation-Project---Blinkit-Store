#BLINKIT STORE AND SALES VISUALISATION

The Blinkit Sales Data Visualization Dashboard provides a unified view of store performance through clear and interactive business intelligence visuals. Designed to transform raw sales data into actionable insights, the dashboard highlights key metrics including total sales ($444.79K), average sales ($142), number of items (3,139), and average customer ratings (3.92).

The dashboard enables business stakeholders to quickly evaluate performance across multiple dimensions:

Outlet Insights: Sales are segmented by outlet size, type, and location tier, offering a comparative view of how different formats and markets contribute to overall revenue.

Time Trends: A sales timeline from 2012 to 2020 tracks growth patterns, peak years, and market slowdowns, supporting future demand forecasting.

Product Categories: Sales distribution across categories such as seafood, snacks, beverages, dairy, and household items reveals consumer demand and category strengths.

Consumer Preferences: Analysis of product attributes like fat content (low-fat vs. regular) uncovers shifts in customer buying behavior.

Outlet Performance Metrics: Tabular insights compare grocery stores and supermarket formats on sales, item counts, visibility, and ratings, identifying top-performing outlets and improvement opportunities.

By combining KPI cards, trend lines, bar charts, and comparative visuals, the dashboard enables fast, data-driven decision-making. Operations, inventory planning, and marketing teams can leverage these insights to optimize product placement, improve supply chain efficiency, and align promotional strategies with consumer preferences.

This project demonstrates how data visualization can transform complex datasets into a business-ready decision support tool, helping Blinkit enhance efficiency, strengthen category performance, and drive revenue growth.
